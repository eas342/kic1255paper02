\begin{abstract}
KIC 12557548 b is one of several disintegrating planet candidates which lose mass in the form of dust particles escaping their surface. Photometric monitoring of KIC 12557548 b originally showed evidence for a slowdown of integration activity in 2013 and 2014. Here, we report 2016 measurements that are consistent with photometry from the Kepler spacecraft in 2009-2013.

\section{Introduction}
The disintegrating planet candidate KIC 12557548 b \citep{rappaport} was the first discovery of a planet candidate causes wildly varying dust obscuration of its host star.
It is now one of many systems that are proposed to be disintegrating planets that are rapidly losing dust that is seen as obscurations toward the host star.

The Kepler spacecraft performed near-continuous long cadence photometry for KIC 12557548 during its entire main mission lifetime from 2009 to 2013.
During this time, the transit depths averaged around $\sim$0.6\% but varied stochastically from just one 15.7 hour orbit to the next.
\citet{vanWerkhoven2014} analyzed 15 of the total 17 quarters of data and calculated every transit depth during this period.
There were two intervals near obits 50 and 1950 that showed shallower (0.1\%) than average transit depths for roughly one month.



Subsequently, \citet{schlawin2016kic1255} observed 8 total transits of the system for 4 nights in 2013 and 4 nights in 2014 for the $r'$ band using the MORIS imager \citep{Gulbis2011} on SpeX/IRTF \citep{rayner03}.
\citet{schlawin2016kic1255} found that the transit depths were all weaker than $0.43\%$ and that the probably of this randomly occurring based on random behavior from Kepler statistics was around 0.2\%.
This was evidence that the observations all fell during weaker periods (as found in \citet{vanWerkhoven2014}'s 15 Kepler quarter analysis) or that the disintegration activity was falling off with time.
We performed follow-up $R$ band photometry of the \shStar\ system to explore whether the disintegration activity is shutting off with time.

\section{Time Series}

As an initial start, I created a time series for the night of UT 2016-06-12.
I used aperture photometry with a source radius of 4 pixels, an inner aperture annulus of 5 pixels and an outer aperture radius of 8 pixels for the background.
I choose 6 reference stars of similar brightness and which were nearby the source on the CCD.
I use the \texttt{photutils} python package for the aperture photometry.
The resulting raw time series can be seen in \ref{fig:initTseries}.

\begin{figure}
\begin{centering}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{initial_t_series.pdf}
\caption{Quick raw time series for UT 2016-06-12. No aperture centering was done (there were fixed apertures with time).
No bias or flat field corrections were applied.}\label{fig:initTseries}
\end{centering}
\end{figure}

The initial time series has huge fluctuations (and even goes negative! due to poor aperture centering at the start).
I used \texttt{photutils.centroid\_2g} to do 2D Gaussian centroiding to choose the aperture positions to start with.
Adding a centroiding routine significantly improves the precision as seen in Figure \ref{fig:secTseries}.


\begin{figure}
\begin{centering}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{second_t_series.pdf}
\caption{Same data for UT 2016-06-12 as Figure \ref{fig:initTseries}.
This time aperture centroiding was done.
No bias or flat field corrections were applied.}\label{fig:secTseries}

This research made use of the \texttt{astropy} package \citep{astropy2013}.

%If  used, this work made use of the \texttt{astropy} package \citep{astropy2013}.
%If used, some data was collected from the Open Exoplanet Catalogue \citep{rein2012openExoCat}.

%% In a manner similar to \objectname authors can provide links to dataset
%% hosted at participating data centers via the \dataset{} command.  The
%% second curly bracket argument is printed in the text while the first
%% parentheses argument serves as the valid data set identifier.  Large
%% lists of data set are best provided in a table (see Table 3 for an example).
%% Valid data set identifiers should be obtained from the data center that
%% is currently hosting the data.
%%
%% Note that AASTeX interprets everything between the curly braces in the 
%% macro as regular text, so any special characters, e.g. "#" or "_," must be 
%% preceded by a backslash. Otherwise, you will get a LaTeX error when you 
%% compile your manuscript.  Special characters do not 
%% need to be escaped in the optional, square-bracket argument.



%% In this section, we use  the \subsection command to set off
%% a subsection.  \footnote is used to insert a footnote to the text.

%% Observe the use of the LaTeX \label
%% command after the \subsection to give a symbolic KEY to the
%% subsection for cross-referencing in a \ref command.
%% You can use LaTeX's \ref and \label commands to keep track of
%% cross-references to sections, equations, tables, and figures.
%% That way, if you change the order of any elements, LaTeX will
%% automatically renumber them.

%% This section also includes several of the displayed math environments
%% mentioned in the Author Guide.


%% The equation environment wil produce a numbered display equation.


%% The \notetoeditor{TEXT} command allows the author to communicate
%% information to the copy editor.  This information will appear as a
%% footnote on the printed copy for the manuscript style file.  Nothing will
%% appear on the printed copy if the preprint or
%% preprint2 style files are used.

%% The eqnarray environment produces multi-line display math. The end of
%% each line is marked with a \\. Lines will be numbered unless the \\
%% is preceded by a \nonumber command.
%% Alignment points are marked by ampersands (&). There should be two
%% ampersands (&) per line.

%% Putting eqnarrays or equations inside the mathletters environment groups
%% the enclosed equations by letter. For instance, the eqnarray below, instead
%% of being numbered, say, (4) and (5), would be numbered (4a) and (4b).
%% LaTeX the paper and look at the output to see the results.

%% This section contains more display math examples, including unnumbered
%% equations (displaymath environment). The last paragraph includes some
%% examples of in-line math featuring a couple of the AASTeX symbol macros.

%% The displaymath environment will produce the same sort of equation as
%% the equation environment, except that the equation will not be numbered
%% by LaTeX.
%% If you wish to include an acknowledgments section in your paper,
%% separate it off from the body of the text using the \acknowledgments
%% command.

%% Included in this acknowledgments section are examples of the
%% AASTeX hypertext markup commands. Use \url without the optional [HREF]
%% argument when you want to print the url directly in the text. Otherwise,
%% use either \url or \anchor, with the HREF as the first argument and the
%% text to be printed in the second.

\acknowledgments



%% To help institutions obtain information on the effectiveness of their
%% telescopes, the AAS Journals has created a group of keywords for telescope
%% facilities. A common set of keywords will make these types of searches
%% significantly easier and more accurate. In addition, they will also be
%% useful in linking papers together which utilize the same telescopes
%% within the framework of the National Virtual Observatory.
%% See the AASTeX Web site at http://aastex.aas.org/
%% for information on obtaining the facility keywords.

%% After the acknowledgments section, use the following syntax and the
%% \facility{} macro to list the keywords of facilities used in the research
%% for the paper.  Each keyword will be checked against the master list during
%% copy editing.  Individual instruments or configurations can be provided 
%% in parentheses, after the keyword, but they will not be verified.

%{\it Facilities:} \facility{Nickel}, \facility{HST (STIS)}, \facility{CXO (ASIS)}.

%% Appendix material should be preceded with a single \appendix command.
%% There should be a \section command for each appendix. Mark appendix
%% subsections with the same markup you use in the main body of the paper.

%% Each Appendix (indicated with \section) will be lettered A, B, C, etc.
%% The equation counter will reset when it encounters the \appendix
%% command and will number appendix equations (A1), (A2), etc.

\appendix

\section{Original Light Curves}

%% The reference list follows the main body and any appendices.
%% Use LaTeX's thebibliography environment to mark up your reference list.
%% Note \begin{thebibliography} is followed by an empty set of
%% curly braces.  If you forget this, LaTeX will generate the error
%% "Perhaps a missing \item?".
%%
%% thebibliography produces citations in the text using \bibitem-\cite
%% cross-referencing. Each reference is preceded by a
%% \bibitem command that defines in curly braces the KEY that corresponds
%% to the KEY in the \cite commands (see the first section above).
%% Make sure that you provide a unique KEY for every \bibitem or else the
%% paper will not LaTeX. The square brackets should contain
%% the citation text that LaTeX will insert in
%% place of the \cite commands.

%% We have used macros to produce journal name abbreviations.
%% AASTeX provides a number of these for the more frequently-cited journals.
%% See the Author Guide for a list of them.

%% Note that the style of the \bibitem labels (in []) is slightly
%% different from previous examples.  The natbib system solves a host
%% of citation expression problems, but it is necessary to clearly
%% delimit the year from the author name used in the citation.
%% See the natbib documentation for more details and options.

%% If you are not including electonic art with your submission, you may
%% mark up your captions using the \figcaption command. See the
%% User Guide for details.
%%
%% No more than seven \figcaption commands are allowed per page,
%% so if you have more than seven captions, insert a \clearpage
%% after every seventh one.

%% Tables should be submitted one per page, so put a \clearpage before
%% each one.

%% Two options are available to the author for producing tables:  the
%% deluxetable environment provided by the AASTeX package or the LaTeX
%% table environment.  Use of deluxetable is preferred.
%%

%% Three table samples follow, two marked up in the deluxetable environment,
%% one marked up as a LaTeX table.

%% In this first example, note that the \tabletypesize{}
%% command has been used to reduce the font size of the table.
%% We also use the \rotate command to rotate the table to
%% landscape orientation since it is very wide even at the
%% reduced font size.
%%
%% Note also that the \label command needs to be placed
%% inside the \tablecaption.

%% This table also includes a table comment indicating that the full
%% version will be available in machine-readable format in the electronic
%% edition.

%% If you use the table environment, please indicate horizontal rules using
%% \tableline, not \hline.
%% Do not put multiple tabular environments within a single table.
%% The optional \label should appear inside the \caption command.



%% If the table is more than one page long, the width of the table can vary
%% from page to page when the default \tablewidth is used, as below.  The
%% individual table widths for each page will be written to the log file; a
%% maximum tablewidth for the table can be computed from these values.
%% The \tablewidth argument can then be reset and the file reprocessed, so
%% that the table is of uniform width throughout. Try getting the widths
%% from the log file and changing the \tablewidth parameter to see how
%% adjusting this value affects table formatting.

%% The \dataset{} macro has also been applied to a few of the objects to
%% show how many observations can be tagged in a table.


%% Tables may also be prepared as separate files. See the accompanying
%% sample file table.tex for an example of an external table file.
%% To include an external file in your main document, use the \input
%% command. Uncomment the line below to include table.tex in this
%% sample file. (Note that you will need to comment out the \documentclass,
%% \begin{document}, and \end{document} commands from table.tex if you want
%% to include it in this document.)

%% \input{table}

%% The following command ends your manuscript. LaTeX will ignore any text
%% that appears after it.
