\begin{abstract}
KIC 12557548 b is one of several disintegrating planet candidates which lose mass in the form of dust particles escaping their surface.
Photometric monitoring of KIC 12557548 b originally showed evidence for a slowdown of disintegration activity in 2013 and 2014.
Here, we report 2016 measurements that are consistent with photometry from the Kepler spacecraft in 2009-2013.
We also evaluate high resolution archival spectra from the Subaru HDS spectrograph and find spectra consistent with a main-sequence T=4500 $\pm$110 K star.

%\section{Abstract}


\section{Introduction}
\citet{rappaport} first reported the discovery of a highly unusual stellar system in the Kepler field.
KIC 12557548's (hereafter \shStar's) light curve exhibits periodic flux dips with a period of 0.653 days.
Surprisingly, the flux dips are neither symmetric in shape nor constant in amplitude, varying from $\sim$ 0\% to $\sim$ 1.2\%.
The amplitudes of the flux dips are highly stochastic and unpredictable from one event to the next 0.653 days later.
This indicates the creation and clearing of material that can cover up to 1\% of the star in $\lesssim$ 1 day timescales.
These unusual light curve behaviors are best explained as dust extinction from material that is escaping a rocky planet (KIC 12557548 b, hereafter \sha) in a short period orbit.
The KIC 12557548 system (hereafter \shStar) has the exciting possibility of being an opportunity to study a planet that has been peeled away layer by layer to reveal an interior core.

The discovery of K2-22b \citep{sanchis-ojedak2-22}, WD 1145+017 \citep{vanderburg2015wdDisintegrating}, KOI 2700 \citep{rappaport2014KOI2700} showed that other systems have similar light curves and that other disintegrating planet systems may be useful laboratories for understanding planet evolution and composition.
Multi-wavelength light curve measurements show that the dust particles can have wavelength-dependent transmission, as predicted from sub-micron dust particles \citep{bochinski2015evolving,sanchis-ojedak2-22}.

Furthermore, there are perplexing systems that also display stochastic transit behavior but for which there are still no agreed-upon explanations: KIC 8462852 (ie. Boyajian's star) \citep{boyajian846}, RIK-210 \citep{david2017rik210} and PTFO 8-8695 \citep{vanEyken2012ptfTTauri}.
KIC 8462852 may be a family of comets from one or more parent bodies that recently were broken apart.
RIK-210 and PTFO 8-8695 are both in young systems ($\lesssim$ 10 and $\lesssim$3 Myr respectively) so they may be proto-planet candidates or structures within a protoplanetary disk.
RIK-210 could be accreting material that causes variable extinction while PTFO 8-8695's orbit may be precessing and causing variations in transit depth depending on its longitude.

The underlying planet candidate \sha\ has not been detected directly, but several observational constraints have placed upper limits on its size and mass.
High precision radial velocity measurements of the host star with Keck/HIRES put an upper limit on the reflex motion due to the planet and constrains the mass to be $\lesssim 1.2 M_{\mathrm Jup}$ \citep{croll2014}.
\citet{masuda2018rvKIC1255} find that the upper limit on the radial velocity semi-amplitude is 86 m/s corresponding to a planet mass $\lesssim 0.28 M_{\mathrm Jup}$ using the Subaru High Dispersion Spectrometer (HDS).
There is no detection of secondary eclipses of \sha\ with a 3$\sigma$ upper limit of $5 \times 10^{-5}$ in the Kepler bandpass, which means that for an albedo of 0.5, the radius of the planet must be smaller than 4600 km \citep{vanWerkhoven2014}.
A radiative-hydrodynamic wind model predicts that the mass loss rate will be a strong function of planet mass and for the present-day mass loss rate of $\sim$ M$_\oplus/Gyr$, the modeled mass is 0.014 $M_\oplus$.

One possible explanation of for the planet disintegration is that it is tied to stellar activity.
\citet{kawahara2013starspots} found an anti-correlation between stellar flux and the depth of transit events, which suggested that the alignment of the planet's position (true anomaly) causes disintegration.
The alignment of spots and disintegration activity could be due to XUV photoevaporation or magnetic reconnection events.
The anti-correlation between stellar flux and transit depth was confirmed by \citet{croll2015starspots} though they find that occultations of star spots can also modulate the transit depth at the 22.9 day rotation period of the star.

The Kepler spacecraft performed near-continuous long cadence photometry for KIC 12557548 during its entire main mission lifetime from 2009 to 2013.
During this time, the transit depths averaged around $\sim$0.6\% but varied stochastically from just one 15.7 hour orbit to the next.
\citet{vanWerkhoven2014} analyzed 15 of the total 17 quarters of data and calculated every transit depth during this period.
There were two intervals near obits 50 and 1950 that showed shallower (0.1\%) than average transit depths for roughly one month in duration.

The Kepler data was used to put constraints on the particle size distribution and composition of the dust particles.
\citet{budaj12} and \citet{brogi2012} modeled the light curve, which includes a slight increase in flux prior before the transit begins.
This pre-ingress flux increase is caused by forward scattering dust particles and the scattering function is sensitive to particle size modulo composition.
\citet{budaj12} and \citet{brogi2012} find particle sizes $\sim$0.1 to $\sim$1.0$\mu$m in size based on this method.
Subsequently, \citet{croll2014} obtained a $K'$-band light curve simultaneously with the Kepler spacecraft to put a constraint on the dust extinction as a function of wavelength.
\citet{croll2014} find a particle size distribution of $\gtrsim 0.5\mu$m.

\citet{schlawin2016kic1255} observed 8 total transits of the system for 4 nights in 2013 and 4 nights in 2014 for the $r'$ band using the MORIS imager \citep{Gulbis2011} on SpeX/IRTF \citep{rayner03}.
The SpeX/IRTF spectrum, though affected by systematic noise, confirmed the \citet{croll2014} result that particle sizes are $\gtrsim 0.5\%$ for a pyroxene composition.
\citet{schlawin2016kic1255} found that the optical transit depths were all weaker than $0.43\%$ and that the probably of this randomly occurring based on random behavior from Kepler statistics was around 0.2\%.
This was evidence that the observations occurred during weaker periods (as found in \citet{vanWerkhoven2014}'s 15 Kepler quarter analysis) or that the disintegration activity was falling off with time.
We performed follow-up $R$ band photometry of the \shStar\ system to explore these two hypotheses and see if the the disintegration has returned to the levels found in the Kepler mission.

The high resolution spectrum of \shStar\ \citep{kawahara2013starspots} showed a different temperature and gravity than photometric methods \cite[e.g.][]{brown2011kic}.
\citet{vanlieshout2016kic1255} suggest that one exciting possibility is that gases from the disintegrating planet contaminate the high resolution spectrum.
This would enable compositional and kinematic studies of the disintegrating planet.
Here, we examine archival Subaru High Dispersion Spectrograph (HDS) spectra of the star to assess the stellar parameters and explore the possibility that sublimated gases appear in the high resolution spectrum.

\section{Photometric Observations}
We attempted to observe 6 transit events of \sha\ with the Mont4k imager on the 61-inch Kuiper observatory located on Mt Bigelow, Arizona on UT using the f/13.5 Cassegrain focus.
On all nights we used 90 second exposures using a Harris-R filter to best approximate the $r'$ filter used in \citet{schlawin2016kic1255}.
5 of the 6 nights were clear with the exception of a few passing clouds on UT 2016 Jul 14.
Cloudy skies on UT 2016 Jun 10 that prevented high precision time series.
Table \ref{tab:photSummary} shows a summary of our observations and the UT dates.
The data was taken in a 3x3 binning mode resulting in an effective 0.43"/pixel plate scale.

\subsection{Photometric Pipeline}

For the photometric reduction, we used the Python \texttt{ccdproc} package \citep{craig2015ccdproc} to generate master flat field and bias files.
They were combined with an average with a low threshold of 2$\sigma$ and a high threshold of 5$\sigma$.

We used the Python \texttt{photutils v0.3} \citep{bradley2016photutilsv0p3} package to centroid and extract fluxes of the \shStar\ and the reference stars.
We used a photometric aperture of 9 pixels (3.9") and a background annulus from 9 to 12 pixels (3.9" to 5.2") on all stars and nights.
12 stable reference stars with similar R band brightnesses were used to construct a reference time series to correct for variable telluric and instrument throughput.
The reference stars are identified Figure \ref{fig:refStars} across the 9.8\arcmin $\times$ 9.8 \arcmin\ Mont4K field of view.
These 12 reference stars' time series were combined with a weighted average and this combined time series was divided into the target, \shStar.

\begin{figure}

The reference stars were chosen to have similar count levels as \shStar.

\end{centering}
\end{figure}

All light curves for \shStar\ and the 12 reference stars are shown in Figure \ref{fig:allNightallStar}.
These are the same reference stars shown in Figure \ref{fig:refStars}.
The two nights 2016 Jun 12 and 2016 Jun 14 show greater overall stability than the 3 nights in July, 2016.
We suspect that the higher moisture levels and occasional cloud passages (such as the ones that caused huge drops in flux on UT 2016 Jul 14) affected the later observations.

\end{centering}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{Transit Depth Fitting}\label{sec:transFitting}

Figure \ref{fig:allNightrefCorrect} shows the reference-corrected time series for \shStar\ for all nights.
We use the planet transit ephemeris from \citet{croll2015starspots} where the Kepler flux minimum is the ``transit center'':
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ephem}
T = T_0 + n P
\end{equation}
where $T_0 = 2 454 968.982 0 \pm 0.000 7$ BJD$_{TDB}$ and $P = 0.653 553 4 \pm 0.000 000 2$ days.
The expected transit epochs from the ephemeris in \citep{vanWerkhoven2014} are shown for reference as vertical red bars.
Typical uncertainties for the Kepler ephemeris are $\sim$ 1 minute at these dates due to the large number of transits measured by the Kepler observatory over nearly 4 years.
The ``transit duration'' from Kepler light curves is about 0.06 days\footnote{We define the transit duration as the point at which the average light curve measured by the Kepler spacecraft drops below 99.95\% of the normalized flux as in \citet{schlawin2016kic1255}}, which is consistent with these transit durations.

We find the best fit to each light curve using the average Kepler short cadence light curve as a model.
We include a linear baseline so that the model is
\begin{equation}\label{eq:transFitting}
F(t) = \left(A \cdot f_{SC}(t) + 1 \right)  (1 + B + C \cdot t),
\end{equation}
where $F(t)$ is the normalized flux at orbital phase $t$, $A$ is the amplitude parameter, $f_{SC}(t)$ is average Kepler short cadence light curve linearly interpolated at an orbital phase $t$, $B$ is the baseline offset and $C$ is the baseline slope.
We construct $f_{SC}(t)$ by phasing the Kepler time series with Equation \ref{eq:ephem}, normalizing by the median, removing a quadratic baseline from each transit, averaging the results and subtracting 1.0 to get the differential flux.
We use the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) package \texttt{emcee} \citep{foreman-mackey2013emcee} to find the transit depth amplitude and uncertainty.
We use 50 MCMC chains with 500 burn-in points and 1500 points to sample the posterior distribution.
The best-fit light curves are shown in Figure \ref{fig:allNightrefCorrect} and the best-fit amplitudes are listed in Table \ref{tab:photSummary}.

\begin{figure*}
\begin{centering}
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images/all_kic1255_phot/all_kic1255_refcor.pdf}
\caption{Reference-corrected time series photometry \shStar\ for all nights (blue circles).
Orange squares mark 20 minute flux bins.
The expected transit epochs from the Kepler-based ephemeris \citep{vanWerkhoven2014} are shown as vertical red bars.
We also show the average Short Cadence Kepler light curves for each of the transit events for comparison with the average.
Transits are clearly visible for all five nights except for UT2016-06-14.}\label{fig:allNightrefCorrect}
\end{centering}
\end{figure*}

To ease the visual comparison of the models and measured data, we bin the 61-inch Mont4K data into 20 minute long bins, shown in Figure \ref{fig:allNightrefCorrect}.
Obvious cosmic ray outliers were discarded by removing points with fluxes below 0.98 and above 1.02 times the median flux.
The error bars for the binned data are calculated from the standard error in the mean for each bin.
When calculating the best fit model and posterior distribution of parameter, however, the un-binned data is used.

In contrast to \citet{schlawin2016kic1255}, the transit depths in 2016 June and 2016 July are similar to the distribution measured by the Kepler spacecraft from 2009 to 2013.
\citet{schlawin2016kic1255} found significantly weaker transit depths that the Kepler spacecraft in 2013 Aug-Sep and 2014 Aug-Sep, which indicated that either disintegration activity was slowing down or that there were quiescent periods during those observations.
The transit depths listed in Table \ref{tab:photSummary} are ``back to normal'' in that they are consistent with the Kepler results.
We will revisit the statistics of these events in Section \ref{sec:Kepler}.

\section{Kepler Re-analysis}\label{sec:Kepler}

We examine the 17 total quarters of Kepler data for three purposes:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item To understand the statistics of the transits and put the 2013-2016 observations in context. Mainly, how likely/unlikely were the weak transits observed in 2013-2014?
	\item To measure the radius of the planet or put an upper limit on its radius by examining any possible transit beneath the dust signal
	\item Identify any new patterns or observations from the Kepler data that might occur along the way
\end{enumerate}

We downloaded all 17 quarters of Kepler Long-Cadence data from the MAST archive beginning on 2009 May 13 and ending on 2013 April 08 for a total of 1425 days or 2181.5 orbits.
The Kepler data were examined for one transit or secondary eclipse at a time with a window of $\pm$0.28 in orbital phase.
A quadratic baseline is fit to all the points before a phase of 0.12 and after a phase of 0.15 within the $\pm$ 0.28 phase window.
All points are divided by this baseline to produce a normalized flux transit or eclipse profile.
The secondary eclipses are used to quantify the noise in the transit depths.

\subsection{Kepler Secondary Eclipse}

We confirm the result of \citet{vanWerkhoven2014} that no secondary eclipse is detected at $\lesssim 50$~ppm, seen in Figure \ref{fig:secEclipse}. 
We then use the secondary eclipses as a way to characterize the noise of the primary eclipses.
Both have the same quadratic baseline removal process over the same time intervals.

\begin{figure*}[!hbtp]
\begin{centering}
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{images/kepler/secondary_eclipse.pdf}
\caption{No secondary eclipse ( $\lesssim$ 50 ppm) is detected from a phase range of -0.25 to 0.75, even with 17 quarters (4 years) of Kepler Long Cadence data.
Here, the data are binned to orbital phases of 0.1 (1.5 minutes) and errors calculated from the standard error in the mean of the data within a bin.
}\label{fig:secEclipse}
\end{centering}
\end{figure*}

(Right) The residuals show significant deviations near phases of -0.5 and 0.05.
}\label{fig:riverPlots}
\end{centering}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{Average Light Curve Analysis}

In order to perform some analysis techniques on the data and to study the transit depth behavior, we first create a uniform cleaned two dimensional array of the time series.
We linearly interpolated the Kepler long-cadence data set onto a fixed phase grid with a spacing of 15 minutes (to Nyquist sample the 30 minute observation cadence) and put together all the time series that have no gaps into this two dimensional grid.
This cleaned Kepler long-cadence array is shown in Figure \ref{fig:riverPlots}.

We start by taking the average transit light curve of all the long cadence data (the mean of the 2D grid along the transit number axis).
We then take the dot product ($\bullet$) with this average light curve to create an amplitude time series.
\begin{equation}
A' \equiv \frac{(f - 1) \bullet \vec{a}}{\vec{a} \bullet \vec{a}},
\end{equation}
where $\vec{a}$ is the amplitude vector, $f$ is the flux matrix with x indices of time and y indices of transit number and $a$ is the average spectrum.
This dot product, $A'$ is comparable to the transit amplitude $A$ in Equation \ref{eq:transFitting}.

This dot product is then multiplied by the average transit light curve to create a 2D model grid.
The residual of this model (Figure \ref{fig:riverPlots}) shows significant $\pm$0.2\% deviations from white noise, indicating that the dusty tail surrounding \sha\ changes in shape with time.
We explore more sophisticated models than the average light curve below that are based on principal component analysis.
However, this average model serves as a useful comparison to fitting the transit depth for ground-based photometry, as performed in Section \ref{sec:transFitting}.
The 0.2\% residuals with this average model are comparable with the typical photometric scatter of $\sim$ 0.1 to 0.2\% for 20 minute timescales in this work and \citet{schlawin2016kic1255}.
We statistically compare the transit depths from the Kepler mission from 2009 to 2013 to the ground-based measurements from 2013 through 2016 in Section \ref{sec:statistics}.

\subsection{Principal Component Analysis}
\begin{figure*}[!hbtp]
\begin{centering}

\caption{Cleaned Kepler Long-cadence data (Left) and model fit using 4 Principal Components (Middle).
The residuals (Right) have $\lesssim 0.1\%$ residuals in contrast to the average-light curve method used in Figure \ref{fig:riverPlots}.
}\label{fig:riverPlotsPCA}
\end{centering}
\end{figure*}

As another way of analyzing the light curve data, we apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to this two dimensional grid.
Here, we are assuming that the grid of orbital phases (spaced by 15 minutes) contains random correlated variables with different realizations along the transit number axis.
The first principal component eigenvector is the linear combination of these random variables that maximizes the variance in the data.
The second principal component eigenvector is the linear combination of these random variables with the next-highest variance while being orthogonal to the first principal component.
This continues up to some finite number of principal components, with the hope that we can use a few orthogonal light curves to adequately describe the data \citep[e.g.][]{jolliffe2002pca}.
We use the Python package \texttt{scikit-learn} \citep{pedregosa2011scikit-learn} to calculate the principal components and eigenvectors.

We use a covariance matrix as opposed to correlation matrix to calculate the principal component eigenvectors.
In other uses of PCA, the variables are often scaled so that they all have a variance of 1.0 to ensure that variables with intrinsically larger variance (such as height in inches over weight in kilograms) do not get higher loadings in the principal component vectors \citep{jolliffe2002pca}.
However, we do not scale the variables (columns) by variance and use a covariance matrix because all of our variables are the same units, flux.
If we scaled each column in this 2D grid by its standard deviation or used a correlation matrix, this would magnify the contribution of photon noise to out-of-transit data over the real astrophysical variability of the inner phases (between $\sim$ -0.12 to $\sim$0.15).
The resulting model and residuals shown in Figure \ref{fig:riverPlotsPCA} are much closer to white noise than the model that uses the dot product with the average light curve.

\caption{The principal component eigenvectors scaled by the square root of the eigenvalues (Top Left), shows that the first component largely describes the extinction while the second and third show the contributions from forward scattering.
The first two principal components (Bottom) do not isolate any separate populations of transits.
As expected, the quiescent periods show up as low principal component contributions from both of the two first two eigenvectors (ie. a flatter light curve)}\label{fig:pcaVectorsComp}
\end{centering}
\end{figure*}

Figure \ref{fig:pcaVectorsComp} shows the first 4 eigenvectors as a function of orbital phase.
We weight each eigenvectors by the square root of the explained variance of each principal component, as is used in meteorology \citep{richman1986pcaRotation}.
The first 4 eigenvectors explain 62\%, 12\%, 6\% and 3\% of the variance (a total of 84\%) for the 32 points in the phase grid from -0.25 to 0.25.
The first eigenvector largely describes extinction from the core of the comet-like tail (modeled in \citet{rappaport}, \citet{brogi2012}, \citet{budaj12} and \citet{vanlieshout2016kic1255}, while the second one corresponds more the forward scattering component.
We also show the first two principal components as a scatter plot in Figure \ref{fig:pcaVectorsComp}.
In some applications of PCA, separate populations of behaviors can appear in these scatter plots (such as different modes of planet disintegration) but here there is a continuous distribution points.
We also color the quiescent periods of very little \sha\ disintegration activity (discussed in \citet{vanWerkhoven2014} and \citet{croll2015starspots}) and these quiescent periods appear as low values for the first two principal components.
This indicates that 

Figure \ref{fig:tserPC1} shows the time series of the first principal component, which tracks well with the dot product with the average light curve.

The 22.9 day peak is consistent with the \citet{kawahara2013starspots} and \citet{croll2015starspots} that shows amplitudes are anti-correlated with stellar flux.
As suggested in \citet{kawahara2013starspots}, the anti-correlation points to a physical mechanism for the disintegration - such as magnetic activity or high energy flux associated with spots causing disintegration on the planet.

The peaks at 153 and 750 days are likely caused by the longer intervals of low disintegration activity.

\end{deluxetable*}


The host star \shStar\ has been characterized by both photometry and spectroscopy to better understand the system and parameters of the disintegrating planet and debris.
Table \ref{tab:stellObsParams} shows the summary of observations and analyses compiled in \citet{vanlieshout2016kic1255} for the stellar properties, re-produced here with additional results added from \citet{morton2016falsePos} and this work.
In the photometric analysis and low resolution spectroscopy, the spectra are consistent with a 4500 K main sequence K-type star.
High resolution spectra, however, indicated a higher temperature 4900 K lower log(g) sub-giant star \citep{kawahara2013starspots}.
\citet{vanlieshout2016kic1255} analyzed the light curve with a dust model to put constraints on the semi-major axis in terms of stellar radii, which can be combined with Kepler's third law to calculate the stellar density \citep{seager2003uniqueSolution}.
\citet{vanlieshout2016kic1255} find that the stellar density is only consistent with a main-sequence star with log(g) $\gtrsim 4.4 \log($cm s$^{-2})$.
They suggest an intriguing possibility that the high resolution spectrum of \shStar\ has contamination from dusty debris from the planet and thus appears as a sub-giant star.
If true, high resolution spectra would be valuable tool to study the composition and dynamics of the material escaping \sha.
In this section, we analyze archival high resolution spectra to put new constraints on the stellar temperature and surface gravity.

\subsection{Subaru HDS Spectra}\label{sec:SubaruDescrip}

We evaluate the stellar parameters by examining the archival spectra taken with the High Definition Spectrograph (HDS) spectrograph on the Subaru telescope \citep{noguchi2002hds}.
An observing log of the 3 nights is summarized in Table \ref{tab:specObs}.
There is one set of data taken on 2013 June 22 (UT) discussed in \citet{kawahara2013starspots}, including 2 exposures each 2700 seconds in duration.
For this 2013 observation, the instrument was configured to use an image slicer unit \#2, which has a resolving power R$\approx$80,000.
Additionally, there are two sets of observations from 2015 Aug 28 (UT) and 2015 Aug 29 (UT) that were taken to test if the planet could be on a high eccentricity grazing orbit \citep{masuda2018rvKIC1255}, with exposure durations of 2400 seconds each.
The instrument was configured with a 0.3 mm (0.6\arcsec) wide and 30 mm long (60\arcsec) slit, which has a resolving power of R $\approx$60,000.
The second set of observations happened after the reaction wheel failure on 2013 May 11\footnote{\url{https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/kepler/news/keplerm-20130521.html}} that ended photometry of the main Kepler field, so no simultaneous Kepler photometry was available with the high dispersion spectroscopy to assess disintegration activity preceding or following the spectra.
None of the observations was timed during a primary transit (phase = 0.0) or secondary eclipse (phase = 0.5 for a circular orbit).

\subsection{Data Reduction}
For the 2015 data, we use the same spectra as in \citep{masuda2018rvKIC1255}.
All telluric emission features and outliers are masked in this analysis to remove these components.
Time-variable outliers like cosmic rays are removed by measuring deviations from the median spectrum for the night.
The night-sky emissions from OH and O$_2$ are removed by using the \citet{osterbrock1996lineAtlas} night sky atlas.
All OH and O$_2$ lines are removed regardless if they are visible in the spectrum of \shStar.
To combine the observations, we found the median spectrum for UT dates 2015 Aug 28 and 2015 Aug 29 to robustly combine the data.
This median spectrum is visible in Figure \ref{fig:mgTripletBOSZ}.

For the 2013 data, we follow the \texttt{iraf} reduction techniques from the instrument manual V2.0.0  \footnote{\url{https://www.subarutelescope.org/Observing/Instruments/HDS/}}.
Some modifications to the manual were made, including a more aggressive -50/+50 lower and upper window for bad pixel identification with \texttt{mkbadpx} on the red CCD.
We applied bad pixel masks and bias files to each CCD (red and blue sides) separately.

We performed wavelength calibration with a Thorium Argon reference spectrum.
The final wavelength calibration fit was performed with a chebyshev polynomial, 4th order in x direction and 4th order in y direction.
This polynomial fit has a RMS error of 0.02$\AA$.

We compare the 2013 and 2015 data to search for any variability in the absorption lines, as seen in Figure \ref{fig:spec2013vs2015}.
Absorption line variability could be caused by disintegration activity of the planet that escapes as dusty material and then sublimates into gas.
This gas absorption could provide kinematic information on escaping material provided that the sublimated gas has sufficient optical depth.
We find no statistically significant differences between the 2013 and 2015 spectra, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:spec2013vs2015}.
We then proceed with the 2015 data to constrain stellar models since it has 6.7 hours of total exposure time compared (compared to 1.5 hours in 2013).

\begin{figure*}[!hbtp]

\end{centering}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{Comparison to BOSZ}
We first evaluate stellar parameters by comparing to the high resolving power ($R=100,000$) BOSZ grids of ATLAS-APOGEE ATLAS9 models \citep{bohlin2017bosz} to the median spectrum from 2015.
Since the discrepancies in the literature are mostly differences in the surface gravity (see Table \ref{tab:stellObsParams}), we study the gravity-sensitive Mg triplet near 517 nm.
The $R=100,000$ models are convolved with a Gaussian kernel that has a standard deviation $\sigma_K = \lambda/161,000 \approx 0.03 \AA$ to best match the data.
This was a smaller we expected from combining inverse resolving powers in quadrature, which would imply that an $R=75,000 $ kernel convolved with an $R=100,000$ spectrum would result in a $R=60,000$ spectrum.
We start by comparing the measured spectrum with two BOSZ models in Figure \ref{fig:mgTripletBOSZ}.
Here, the two BOSZ models are broadly representative of the two types of results in Table \ref{tab:stellObsParams} (log(g)=4.5 and log(g)=4.0).
The higher gravity log(g)=4.5 model appears to match the data better in terms of line ratios but does not explain all of the line depths in the spectrum.

\begin{figure}[!hbtp]
\begin{centering}
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{images/subaru/bosz_mg_triplet_median_spec_w_5000.pdf}
\caption{Median spectrum of \shStar\ \citep{masuda2018rvKIC1255} near the Mg triplet compared to 4500 K BOSZ models with two different log(g)s.}\label{fig:mgTripletBOSZ}
\end{centering}
\end{figure}

We explore the 5 parameters in the BOSZ models: T$_{eff}$, log(g), [M/H], [$\alpha$/M] and [C/M] to constrain these parameters in \shStar.
The sensitivity to each parameter for the BOSZ models are shown in Figure \ref{fig:boszModelParamsMedianSpec}.
For each parameter, we change the models by about 2 steps in the BOSZ grid.
For a quantitative measure of the goodness-of-fit, we calculate a $\chi^2$ over the Mg triplet lines from 5160 to 5190 $\AA$.
The errors are estimated from the standard deviation of the spectra over the night.

%A temperature near 4500 K, log(g) = 4.0-4.5, high metallicity ([M/H] $\approx$ 0.5), low $\alpha$ enrichment ($\alpha \approx -0.25$ and solar Carbon to metals ([C/M] $\approx$ 0) are favored by the models.

\end{centering}
\end{figure*}

After initial constraints on the models from the sensitivity to parameters search, we downloaded a grid of BOSZ models with temperatures ranging from 4250 K to 4750 K, Log(g) from 4.0 to 4.5, [M/H] from 0.0 to 0.5, [C/M]=0.0 and [$\alpha$/M] = -0.25 to 0.0.
We found the model with the  $\chi^2$ statistic over the Mg triple lines from 5160 to 51690 $\AA$
As discussed above, we use an approximate $\chi^2$ statistic over the wavelength range covering the Mg triplet (5160 $\AA$ to 5190 $\AA$).
The minimum $\chi^2$ model for this entire grid is the same as shown in Figure \ref{fig:boszModelParamsMedianSpec} on the Bottom Right: T=4500 K, Log(g)=4.5, M/H=0.0, C/M=0.0, $\alpha=-0.25$.
This is similar to the log(g)$\approx$4.6, T=4500 stellar parameters derived from photometry and low resolution spectroscopy listed in Table \ref{tab:stellObsParams}.

\subsection{SpecMatch-Emp}\label{sec:SpecMatch-Emp}

We also use the open-source \texttt{SpecMatch-Emp} tool \citep{yee2017specMatch} to estimate the stellar parameters using the Subaru spectrum.
\texttt{SpecMatch-Emp} uses a library of Keck HIRES spectra to match the spectrum and derive stellar parameters.
%The median spectrum from 2015 has a resolution of $R=60,000$, which is close to the \texttt{SpecMatch-Emp} grid of $R=55,000$, so we do not convolve the input data for \texttt{SpecMatch-Emp}.
We cut the spectrum to a region from 5140~$\AA$ to 5190~$\AA$ to focus on the gravity-sensitive Mg triplet.

Figure \ref{fig:SpecMatch-Emp} shows the chi-squared differences between the median Subaru spectrum and the models.
The effective temperature and radius parameters show clear global $\chi^2$ minima for the HIRES spectral libraries.
However, the metallicity is less well constrained.
The resulting best-fit parameters from \texttt{SpecMatch-Emp} are T$_{eff}$=4500 K $\pm$ 110 K, [Fe/H]=-0.1$\pm$0.1, log(g)=4.5$\pm$0.1, R=0.7 $\pm$ 0.1 R$_\odot$ and Mass=0.7 $\pm 0.1 $M$_\odot$.
The output \texttt{SpecMatch-Emp} age constraint of 9.6 $\pm$ 0.2 Gyr is likely an underestimated error in the age.
Figure \ref{fig:SpecMatch-EmpComb} shows the linear combination of spectra that best-fit \shStar\ from \texttt{SpecMatch-Emp}.

\begin{figure*}[!hbtp]
\begin{centering}
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images/subaru/spec_chi_min.pdf}
\caption{$\chi^2$ as a function of stellar parameters found by \texttt{SpecMatch-Emp}.
The effective temperature and radii show clear global minima.}\label{fig:SpecMatch-Emp}
\end{centering}
\end{figure*}

We summarize these \texttt{SpecMatch-Emp} and BOSZ results in Table \ref{tab:stellObsParams}, which both favor a main-sequence log(g) $\approx$ 4.6 star.
Our analysis of the median 2015 spectrum therefore indicates that the stellar spectrum shows no strong contamination from planet disintegration activity.
Unfortunately, this makes diagnosing the gaseous material evaporating from sublimated dust grains challenging to detect.
A brighter transiting disintegrating system may reveal itself more strongly, if discovered in the TESS field.

\begin{figure*}[!hbtp]
\begin{centering}
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images/subaru/lincomb_kic1255.pdf}
\caption{Linear combination of templates that best matches KIC 1255.}\label{fig:SpecMatch-EmpComb}
\end{centering}
\end{figure*}

We posit that the initial analysis of the 2013 Subaru spectrum \citep{kawahara2013starspots} that found a temperature and log(g) of 4950 K and 3.9 log(cm/s$^{-2}$) was affected by insufficient signal to noise in the spectrum.
The 2013 data has a 30\% smaller count rate (in e$^-$/s) than the 2015 data likely because the 2013 weather and guiding were sub-optimal.
On top of that, the total exposure time for the 2013 observations was only 1.5 hours.
The consequence of the increased noise in the 2013 spectra affected the interpretation of this high resolution spectrum.
For example, the SNR of the Na D lines was $\sim$ 30, which is near the threshold needed for the \citet{takeda2005specFGKdwarfs} equivalent width method employed in the initial analysis.
We therefore conclude that the noise in the spectrum affected the stellar parameters rather than gas absorption from sublimating dust grains.

%% Use the figure environment and \plotone or \plottwo to include
%% figures and captions in your electronic submission.
%% To embed the sample graphics in
%% the file, uncomment the \plotone, \plottwo, and
%% \includegraphics commands
%%
%% If you need a layout that cannot be achieved with \plotone or
%% \plottwo, you can invoke the graphicx package directly with the
%% \includegraphics command or use \plotfiddle. For more information,
%% please see the tutorial on "Using Electronic Art with AASTeX" in the
%% documentation section at the AASTeX Web site, http://aastex.aas.org/
%%
%% The examples below also include sample markup for submission of
%% supplemental electronic materials. As always, be sure to check
%% the instructions to authors for the journal you are submitting to
%% for specific submissions guidelines as they vary from
%% journal to journal.

%% This example uses \plotone to include an EPS file scaled to
%% 80% of its natural size with \epsscale. Its caption
%% has been written to indicate that additional figure parts will be
%% available in the electronic journal.

%\begin{figure}
%\epsscale{.80}
%\plotone{f1.eps}
%\caption{Derived spectra for 3C138 \citep[see][]{heiles03}. Plots for all sources are available
%in the electronic edition of {\it The Astrophysical Journal}.\label{fig1}}
%\end{figure}

%\clearpage

%% Here we use \plottwo to present two versions of the same figure,
%% one in black and white for print the other in RGB color
%% for online presentation. Note that the caption indicates
%% that a color version of the figure will be available online.
%%

%\begin{figure}
%\plottwo{f2.eps}{f2_color.eps}
%\caption{A panel taken from Figure 2 of \citet{rudnick03}. 
%See the electronic edition of the Journal for a color version 
%of this figure.\label{fig2}}
%\end{figure}

%% This figure uses \includegraphics to scale and rotate the still frame
%% for an mpeg animation.

%\begin{figure}
%\includegraphics[angle=90,scale=.50]{f3.eps}
%\caption{Animation still frame taken from \citet{kim03}.
%This figure is also available as an mpeg
%animation in the electronic edition of the
%{\it Astrophysical Journal}.}
%\end{figure}

%% If you are not including electonic art with your submission, you may
%% mark up your captions using the \figcaption command. See the
%% User Guide for details.
%%
%% No more than seven \figcaption commands are allowed per page,
%% so if you have more than seven captions, insert a \clearpage
%% after every seventh one.

%% Tables should be submitted one per page, so put a \clearpage before
%% each one.

%% Two options are available to the author for producing tables:  the
%% deluxetable environment provided by the AASTeX package or the LaTeX
%% table environment.  Use of deluxetable is preferred.
%%

%% Three table samples follow, two marked up in the deluxetable environment,
%% one marked up as a LaTeX table.

%% In this first example, note that the \tabletypesize{}
%% command has been used to reduce the font size of the table.
%% We also use the \rotate command to rotate the table to
%% landscape orientation since it is very wide even at the
%% reduced font size.
%%
%% Note also that the \label command needs to be placed
%% inside the \tablecaption.

%% This table also includes a table comment indicating that the full
%% version will be available in machine-readable format in the electronic
%% edition.

%% If you use the table environment, please indicate horizontal rules using
%% \tableline, not \hline.
%% Do not put multiple tabular environments within a single table.
%% The optional \label should appear inside the \caption command.



%% If the table is more than one page long, the width of the table can vary
%% from page to page when the default \tablewidth is used, as below.  The
%% individual table widths for each page will be written to the log file; a
%% maximum tablewidth for the table can be computed from these values.
%% The \tablewidth argument can then be reset and the file reprocessed, so
%% that the table is of uniform width throughout. Try getting the widths
%% from the log file and changing the \tablewidth parameter to see how
%% adjusting this value affects table formatting.

%% The \dataset{} macro has also been applied to a few of the objects to
%% show how many observations can be tagged in a table.


%% Tables may also be prepared as separate files. See the accompanying
%% sample file table.tex for an example of an external table file.
%% To include an external file in your main document, use the \input
%% command. Uncomment the line below to include table.tex in this
%% sample file. (Note that you will need to comment out the \documentclass,
%% \begin{document}, and \end{document} commands from table.tex if you want
%% to include it in this document.)

%% \input{table}

%% The following command ends your manuscript. LaTeX will ignore any text
%% that appears after it.

\end{document}

%% End of file `sample.tex'.
