\section{Abstract}
KIC 12557548 b is one of several disintegrating planet candidates which lose mass in the form of dust particles escaping their surface. Photometric monitoring of KIC 12557548 b originally showed evidence for a slowdown of integration activity in 2013 and 2014. Here, we report 2016 measurements that are consistent with photometry from the Kepler spacecraft in 2009-2013.
We also examine the system with high resolution spectroscopy and discuss the parameters of the host star.

\section{Introduction}
\citet{rappaport} first reported the discovery of a highly unusual stellar system in the Kepler field.
KIC 12557548's (hereafter \shStar's) light curve exhibits periodic flux dips with a period of 0.653 days.
Surprisingly, the flux dips are neither symmetric in shape nor constant in amplitude, varying from $\sim$ 0\% to $\sim$ 1.2\%.
The amplitudes of the flux dips are highly stochastic and unpredictable from one event to the next 0.653 days later.
This indicates the creation and clearing of material that can cover up to 1\% of the star in $\lesssim$ 1 day timescales.
These unusual light curve behaviors are best explained as dust extinction from material that is escaping a rocky planet (KIC 12557548 b, hereafter \sha) in a short period orbit.
The \shStar\ system has the exciting possibility of being an opportunity to study a planet that has been peeled away layer by layer to reveal an interior core.

%The discovery of K2-22b \citep{sanchis-ojedak2-22}, WD 1145+017 \citep{vanderburg2015wdDisintegrating}, KOI 2700 \citep{rappaport2014KOI2700} showed that other systems have similar light curves and that other disintegrating planet systems may be useful laboratories for understanding disintegrating planets.
%Multi-wavelength light curve measurements show that the dust particles can have wavelength-dependent transmission, as predicted from sub-micron dust particles \citep{bochinski2015evolving,sanchis-ojedak2-22}.

%Furthermore, there are perplexing systems that also display stochastic transit behavior but for which there are still no agreed-upon explanations: KIC 8462852 (ie. Boyajian's star) \citep{boyajian846}, RIK-210 \citep{david2017rik210} and PTFO 8-8695 \citep{vanEyken2012ptfTTauri}.
%KIC 8462852 may be a family of comets from one or more parent bodies that recently were broken apart.
%RIK-210 and PTFO 8-8695 are both in young systems ($\lesssim$ 10 and $\lesssim$3 Myr respectively) so they may are proto-planet candidates.
%RIK-210 may have accreting material that causes variable extinction while PTFO 8-8695's orbit may be precessing and causing variations in transit depth depending on its longitude.

%The underlying planet candidate \sha\ has not been detected directly, but several observational constraints have placed upper limits on its size and mass.
%High precision radial velocity measurements of the host star put an upper limit on the reflex motion due to the planet and constrains the mass to be $\lesssim 1.2 M_{\mathrm Jup}$ \citep{croll2014}.
%There is no detection of secondary eclipses of \sha\ with a 3$\sigma$ upper limit of $5 \times 10^{-5}$ in the Kepler bandpass, which means that for an albedo of 0.5, the radius of the planet must be smaller than 4600 km \citep{vanWerkhoven2014}.
%The timescale of the variability of the transits gives a mass lot rate of order $\sim M_\oplus/Gyr$, which would indicate a present-day mass of 0.014 $M_\oplus$ when using a radiative-hydrodynamic wind model \citep{perez-becker}.

The Kepler spacecraft performed near-continuous long cadence photometry for KIC 12557548 during its entire main mission lifetime from 2009 to 2013.
During this time, the transit depths averaged around $\sim$0.6\% but varied stochastically from just one 15.7 hour orbit to the next.
\citet{vanWerkhoven2014} analyzed 15 of the total 17 quarters of data and calculated every transit depth during this period.
There were two intervals near obits 50 and 1950 that showed shallower (0.1\%) than average transit depths for roughly one month.

Subsequently, \citet{schlawin2016kic1255} observed 8 total transits of the system for 4 nights in 2013 and 4 nights in 2014 for the $r'$ band using the MORIS imager \citep{Gulbis2011} on SpeX/IRTF \citep{rayner03}.
\citet{schlawin2016kic1255} found that the transit depths were all weaker than $0.43\%$ and that the probably of this randomly occurring based on random behavior from Kepler statistics was around 0.2\%.
This was evidence that the observations occurred during weaker periods (as found in \citet{vanWerkhoven2014}'s 15 Kepler quarter analysis) or that the disintegration activity was falling off with time.
We performed follow-up $R$ band photometry of the \shStar\ system to explore whether the disintegration activity was decreasing as a function of time.
We also analyze high resolution spectroscopy of the system to help resolve some of the different stellar parameters reported in the literature.

\section{Observations}
We observed \sha\ with the Mont4k imager on the 61-inch Kuiper observatory on UT dates 2016-06-12, 2016-06-14, 2016-07-12, 2016-07-14, 2016-07-16.
The nights were clear with the exception of a few passing clouds on 2016-07-14.
We also attempted photometry on 2016-06-10, but clouds prevented precision time series.

\subsection{Photometric Pipeline}

For the photometric reduction, we used the \texttt{ccdproc} package to generate master flat field and bias files.
They were combined with an average with a low threshold of 2$\sigma$ and a high threshold of 5$\sigma$.
12 stable reference stars with similar R band brightnesses were used to construct a reference time series to correct for variable telluric and instrument throughput.
These 12 reference stars' time series were combined with a weighted average and this combined time series was divided into the target, \sha.

Figure \ref{fig:allNightrefCorrect} shows the reference-corrected time series for \shStar\ showing transits.
We use the following planet transit ephemeris, using the flux minimum from Kepler data \citep{schlawin2016kic1255} and the orbital period from \citet{vanWerkhoven2014}.
\begin{equation}
T = T_0 + n P
\end{equation}
where $T_0 = 2454833.039$ BJD$_{TDB}$ and $P = 0.653 553 8 \pm 0.000 000 1$ days.

The expected transit epochs from the ephemeris in \citep{vanWerkhoven2014} are shown for reference.
Typical uncertainties for the Kepler ephemeris are $\sim$ 1 minute at these dates (considering only the uncertainty in period since the transit center is ill-defined).
The ``transit duration'' from Kepler light curves is around 0.05 days, which is consistent with these transit durations.

The expected transit epochs from the Kepler-based ephemeris \citep{vanWerkhoven2014} are shown as vertical red bars.
We also show the average Short Cadence Kepler light curves for each of the transit events for comparison with the average.
Transits are clearly visible for all five nights except for UT2016-06-14.}\label{fig:allNightrefCorrect}

%% In a manner similar to \objectname authors can provide links to dataset
%% hosted at participating data centers via the \dataset{} command.  The
%% second curly bracket argument is printed in the text while the first
%% parentheses argument serves as the valid data set identifier.  Large
%% lists of data set are best provided in a table (see Table 3 for an example).
%% Valid data set identifiers should be obtained from the data center that

%% preceded by a backslash. Otherwise, you will get a LaTeX error when you 
%% compile your manuscript.  Special characters do not 
%% need to be escaped in the optional, square-bracket argument.



%% In this section, we use  the \subsection command to set off
%% a subsection.  \footnote is used to insert a footnote to the text.

%% Observe the use of the LaTeX \label
%% command after the \subsection to give a symbolic KEY to the
%% subsection for cross-referencing in a \ref command.
%% You can use LaTeX's \ref and \label commands to keep track of
%% cross-references to sections, equations, tables, and figures.
%% That way, if you change the order of any elements, LaTeX will
%% automatically renumber them.

%% This section also includes several of the displayed math environments
%% mentioned in the Author Guide.


%% The equation environment wil produce a numbered display equation.


%% The \notetoeditor{TEXT} command allows the author to communicate
%% information to the copy editor.  This information will appear as a
%% footnote on the printed copy for the manuscript style file.  Nothing will
%% appear on the printed copy if the preprint or
%% preprint2 style files are used.

%% The eqnarray environment produces multi-line display math. The end of
%% each line is marked with a \\. Lines will be numbered unless the \\
%% is preceded by a \nonumber command.
%% Alignment points are marked by ampersands (&). There should be two
%% ampersands (&) per line.

%% Putting eqnarrays or equations inside the mathletters environment groups
%% the enclosed equations by letter. For instance, the eqnarray below, instead
%% of being numbered, say, (4) and (5), would be numbered (4a) and (4b).
%% LaTeX the paper and look at the output to see the results.

%% This section contains more display math examples, including unnumbered
%% equations (displaymath environment). The last paragraph includes some
%% examples of in-line math featuring a couple of the AASTeX symbol macros.

%% The displaymath environment will produce the same sort of equation as
%% the equation environment, except that the equation will not be numbered
%% by LaTeX.
%% If you wish to include an acknowledgments section in your paper,
%% separate it off from the body of the text using the \acknowledgments
%% command.

%% Included in this acknowledgments section are examples of the
%% AASTeX hypertext markup commands. Use \url without the optional [HREF]
%% argument when you want to print the url directly in the text. Otherwise,
%% use either \url or \anchor, with the HREF as the first argument and the
%% text to be printed in the second.

\acknowledgments



%% To help institutions obtain information on the effectiveness of their
%% telescopes, the AAS Journals has created a group of keywords for telescope
%% facilities. A common set of keywords will make these types of searches
%% significantly easier and more accurate. In addition, they will also be
%% useful in linking papers together which utilize the same telescopes
%% within the framework of the National Virtual Observatory.
%% See the AASTeX Web site at http://aastex.aas.org/
%% for information on obtaining the facility keywords.

%% After the acknowledgments section, use the following syntax and the
%% \facility{} macro to list the keywords of facilities used in the research
%% for the paper.  Each keyword will be checked against the master list during
%% copy editing.  Individual instruments or configurations can be provided 
%% in parentheses, after the keyword, but they will not be verified.

%{\it Facilities:} \facility{Nickel}, \facility{HST (STIS)}, \facility{CXO (ASIS)}.

%% Appendix material should be preceded with a single \appendix command.
%% There should be a \section command for each appendix. Mark appendix
%% subsections with the same markup you use in the main body of the paper.

%% Each Appendix (indicated with \section) will be lettered A, B, C, etc.
%% The equation counter will reset when it encounters the \appendix
%% command and will number appendix equations (A1), (A2), etc.

\appendix

%% The reference list follows the main body and any appendices.
%% Use LaTeX's thebibliography environment to mark up your reference list.
%% Note \begin{thebibliography} is followed by an empty set of
%% curly braces.  If you forget this, LaTeX will generate the error
%% "Perhaps a missing \item?".
%%
%% thebibliography produces citations in the text using \bibitem-\cite
%% cross-referencing. Each reference is preceded by a
%% \bibitem command that defines in curly braces the KEY that corresponds
%% to the KEY in the \cite commands (see the first section above).
%% Make sure that you provide a unique KEY for every \bibitem or else the
%% paper will not LaTeX. The square brackets should contain
%% the citation text that LaTeX will insert in
%% place of the \cite commands.

%% We have used macros to produce journal name abbreviations.
%% AASTeX provides a number of these for the more frequently-cited journals.
%% See the Author Guide for a list of them.

%% Note that the style of the \bibitem labels (in []) is slightly
%% different from previous examples.  The natbib system solves a host
%% of citation expression problems, but it is necessary to clearly
%% delimit the year from the author name used in the citation.
%% See the natbib documentation for more details and options.
