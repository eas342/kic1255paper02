\begin{abstract}
KIC 12557548 b is one of several disintegrating planet candidates which lose mass in the form of dust particles escaping their surface.
Photometric monitoring of KIC 12557548 b originally showed evidence for a slowdown of integration activity in 2013 and 2014.
Here, we report 2016 measurements that are consistent with photometry from the Kepler spacecraft in 2009-2013.
We also evaluate high resolution spectra from the Subaru HDS spectrograph and find spectra consistent with a main-sequence T=4500 K, main-sequence star.

%\section{Abstract}


\section{Introduction}
\citet{rappaport} first reported the discovery of a highly unusual stellar system in the Kepler field.
KIC 12557548's (hereafter \shStar's) light curve exhibits periodic flux dips with a period of 0.653 days.
Surprisingly, the flux dips are neither symmetric in shape nor constant in amplitude, varying from $\sim$ 0\% to $\sim$ 1.2\%.
The amplitudes of the flux dips are highly stochastic and unpredictable from one event to the next 0.653 days later.
This indicates the creation and clearing of material that can cover up to 1\% of the star in $\lesssim$ 1 day timescales.
These unusual light curve behaviors are best explained as dust extinction from material that is escaping a rocky planet (KIC 12557548 b, hereafter \sha) in a short period orbit.
The \shStar\ system has the exciting possibility of being an opportunity to study a planet that has been peeled away layer by layer to reveal an interior core.

The discovery of K2-22b \citep{sanchis-ojedak2-22}, WD 1145+017 \citep{vanderburg2015wdDisintegrating}, KOI 2700 \citep{rappaport2014KOI2700} showed that other systems have similar light curves and that other disintegrating planet systems may be useful laboratories for understanding disintegrating planets.
Multi-wavelength light curve measurements show that the dust particles can have wavelength-dependent transmission, as predicted from sub-micron dust particles \citep{bochinski2015evolving,sanchis-ojedak2-22}.

Furthermore, there are perplexing systems that also display stochastic transit behavior but for which there are still no agreed-upon explanations: KIC 8462852 (ie. Boyajian's star) \citep{boyajian846}, RIK-210 \citep{david2017rik210} and PTFO 8-8695 \citep{vanEyken2012ptfTTauri}.
KIC 8462852 may be a family of comets from one or more parent bodies that recently were broken apart.
RIK-210 and PTFO 8-8695 are both in young systems ($\lesssim$ 10 and $\lesssim$3 Myr respectively) so they may be proto-planet candidates.
RIK-210 may have accreting material that causes variable extinction while PTFO 8-8695's orbit may be precessing and causing variations in transit depth depending on its longitude.

The underlying planet candidate \sha\ has not been detected directly, but several observational constraints have placed upper limits on its size and mass.
High precision radial velocity measurements of the host star put an upper limit on the reflex motion due to the planet and constrains the mass to be $\lesssim 1.2 M_{\mathrm Jup}$ \citep{croll2014}.
There is no detection of secondary eclipses of \sha\ with a 3$\sigma$ upper limit of $5 \times 10^{-5}$ in the Kepler bandpass, which means that for an albedo of 0.5, the radius of the planet must be smaller than 4600 km \citep{vanWerkhoven2014}.
The timescale of the variability of the transits gives a mass lot rate of order $\sim M_\oplus/Gyr$, which would indicate a present-day mass of 0.014 $M_\oplus$ when using a radiative-hydrodynamic wind model \citep{perez-becker}.

The Kepler spacecraft performed near-continuous long cadence photometry for KIC 12557548 during its entire main mission lifetime from 2009 to 2013.
During this time, the transit depths averaged around $\sim$0.6\% but varied stochastically from just one 15.7 hour orbit to the next.
\citet{vanWerkhoven2014} analyzed 15 of the total 17 quarters of data and calculated every transit depth during this period.
There were two intervals near obits 50 and 1950 that showed shallower (0.1\%) than average transit depths for roughly one month.

Subsequently, \citet{schlawin2016kic1255} observed 8 total transits of the system for 4 nights in 2013 and 4 nights in 2014 for the $r'$ band using the MORIS imager \citep{Gulbis2011} on SpeX/IRTF \citep{rayner03}.
\citet{schlawin2016kic1255} found that the optical transit depths were all weaker than $0.43\%$ and that the probably of this randomly occurring based on random behavior from Kepler statistics was around 0.2\%.
This was evidence that the observations occurred during weaker periods (as found in \citet{vanWerkhoven2014}'s 15 Kepler quarter analysis) or that the disintegration activity was falling off with time.
We performed follow-up $R$ band photometry of the \shStar\ system to explore the second hypothesis: that the disintegration activity decreases as function of time.

\section{Observations}
We observed \sha\ with the Mont4k imager on the 61-inch Kuiper observatory on UT dates 2016-06-12, 2016-06-14, 2016-07-12, 2016-07-14, 2016-07-16.
The nights were clear with the exception of a few passing clouds on 2016-07-14.
We also attempted photometry on 2016-06-10, but clouds prevented precision time series.
Table \ref{tab:photSummary} shows a summary of our observations and the UT dates.

\subsection{Photometric Pipeline}

For the photometric reduction, we used the \texttt{ccdproc} package to generate master flat field and bias files.
They were combined with an average with a low threshold of 2$\sigma$ and a high threshold of 5$\sigma$.
12 stable reference stars with similar R band brightnesses were used to construct a reference time series to correct for variable telluric and instrument throughput.
These 12 reference stars' time series were combined with a weighted average and this combined time series was divided into the target, \sha.

For the photometric reduction, we used the \texttt{ccdproc} package to generate master flat field and bias files.
I combined with an average with a low threshold of 2$\sigma$ and a high threshold of 5$\sigma$.

\end{centering}
\end{figure}

All nights light curves are shown in Figure \ref{fig:allNightallStar}.
These are the same reference stars shown in Figure \ref{fig:ut2016-07-14cloudImg}.
The nights two nights in June, 2016 show greater overall stability than the ones in July, 2016.
I suspect that this can mostly be explained by moisture and clouds (such as the ones that caused huge drops in flux on UT2016-07-14.

\end{centering}
\end{figure*}


Figure \ref{fig:allNightrefCorrect} shows the reference-corrected time series for \shStar\ for all 5 nights which were timed with transits.
We use the following planet transit ephemeris, using the flux minimum ``transit center'' from Kepler data \citep{schlawin2016kic1255} and the orbital period from \citet{vanWerkhoven2014}.
\begin{equation}
T = T_0 + n P
\end{equation}
where $T_0 = 2454833.039$ BJD$_{TDB}$ and $P = 0.653 553 8 \pm 0.000 000 1$ days.

The expected transit epochs from the ephemeris in \citep{vanWerkhoven2014} are shown for reference.
Typical uncertainties for the Kepler ephemeris are $\sim$ 1 minute at these dates (considering only the uncertainty in period since the transit center is ill-defined).
The ``transit duration'' from Kepler light curves is around 0.05 days, which is consistent with these transit durations.

We also show the average Short Cadence Kepler light curves for each of the transit events for comparison with the average.
Transits are clearly visible for all five nights except for UT2016-06-14.}\label{fig:allNightrefCorrect}

\tablenotetext{}{While most of the photometric results show a surface gravity of a main sequence star, the high resolution analysis from \citet{kawahara2013starspots} indicates a gravity consistent with a sub-giant star.}\label{tab:stellObsParams}
\end{deluxetable*}


The host star \shStar\ has been characterized by both photometry and spectroscopy.
Table \ref{tab:stellObsParams} shows the summary of observations and analyses compiled in \citet{vanlieshout2016kic1255} for the stellar properties, re-produced here.
In the photometric analysis and low resolution spectroscopy, the spectra are consistent with a 4500 K main sequence K-type star.
High resolution spectra, however, indicate a higher temperature 4900 K lower log(g) sub-giant star \citep{kawahara2013starspots}.
\citet{vanlieshout2016kic1255} analyzed the light curve with a dust model to put constraints on the semi-major axis, which in turn constrains the density of the star when combined with Kepler's third law \citep{seager2003uniqueSolution}.
\citet{vanlieshout2016kic1255} find that the stellar density is only consistent with a main-sequence star with log(g) $\gtrsim 4.4 \log($cm s$^{-2})$.
They suggest an intriguing possibility that the high resolution spectrum of \shStar\ has contamination from dusty debris from the planet and thus appears as a sub-giant star.
If true, high resolution spectra would be valuable tool to study the composition and dynamics of the material escaping \sha.

\subsection{Subaru HDS Spectra}

We decided to re-visit the stellar parameters by examining the spectra taken with the High Definition Spectrograph (HDS) spectrograph on the Subaru telescope \citep{noguchi2002hds}.
There is one set of data taken on 2013-06-22 discussed in \citet{kawahara2013starspots}.
Additionally, there is one set of observations from 2015-08-28 that was taken to understand the kinematics of the system.
Both of these observations happened after the reaction wheel failure on 2015-05-11\footnote{https://www.nasa.gov/mission\_pages/kepler/news/keplerm-20130521.html}, so no simultaneous Kepler photometry was available with the high dispersion spectroscopy.

\subsection{Independent Iraf Reduction}

In one independent analysis (E Schlawin), we we follow the \texttt{iraf} reduction techniques from the instrument manual\footnote{https://www.subarutelescope.org/Observing/Instruments/\\HDS/specana2014.10e.pdf}.
Some modifications to the manual were made, including a more aggressive -50/+50 lower and upper window for bad pixel identification with \texttt{mkbadpx} on the red CCD.
We applied bad pixel masks and bias files to each CCD (red and blue sides) separately.

The 2013 HDS data and 2015 HDS data were taken in slightly different modes.
Figure \ref{fig:prof2013vs2015} shows an example blue-chip images from 2013 and 2015.
The 2015 data, with a narrow slit (0.3 $\times$ 3.5 mm, R=50,000)\footnote{https://www.subarutelescope.org/Observing/Instruments/\\HDS/ume/node16.html} has a sharper PSF and and is easier to trace.
The 2013 data was taken with a wider (2 $\times$ 30 mm) slit and an image slicer, which create 3 parallel traces for \shStar.
The \texttt{iraf} tracing routines fail with the image slicer, so we use a a flat field with a narrower (0.3 mm) slit to create traces for the 2013 data with the image slicer.
For wavelength identification, a Thorium Argon reference is used.
(Note to self:) The IRAF order 39 appears to be near 6370 $\AA$ to 6450 $\AA$ which is Order 95/Aperture 16 in the Subaru HDS Th-Ar atlas.
The Th-Ar line identification was started with the atlas, rejecting high sigma points and then used to find the rest of the lines automatically.
The final wavelength calibration fit was performed with a chebyshev polynomial, 4th order in x direction and 4th order in y direction.
The final rms in this wavelength solution is 0.0021 $\AA$.
After the reference spectrum is used to find a wavelength solution, the spectrum is examined near some strong stellar lines, including the Na D$_1$/D$_2$ lines (Figure \ref{fig:naDlines}), the Mg Triplet (Figure \ref{fig:mgTriplet}) and the Ca I 6262 $\AA$ line (Figure \ref{fig:CaILine}).

\subsection{Comparison to Templates}

The Mg Triplet (Figure \ref{fig:mgTriplet}) is diagnostic of spectral type and may help resolve some of the conflicts in the literature about the gravity of the host star.
\citet{kawahara2013starspots} find a log(g) = 3.9 $\pm$ 0.2, whereas \citet{rappaport} find a log(g)=4.63.
To compare to some HIGHRES models \citep{coelho2014hires}, we first had to convolve the spectrum.
Also, we interpolated over any pixels above a normalized flux of 2.0 in Figure \ref{fig:mgTriplet} (top).
Then, we convolve with a Gaussian kernel with a standard deviation of 6 pixels.

The region near the Mg triplet in Figure \ref{fig:mgTriplet} is a closer match in terms of line ratios to the higher log(g) =4.5 and T=4500 K spectrum from HIGHRES, but not the line strengths.
In figure \ref{fig:CaILine} we zoom in on the Ca I 6162 $\AA$ feature.
Again, there is no clear match to either BOSZ model.

\begin{figure}[!hbtp]
\begin{centering}
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{images/subaru/CaI6162_spec.pdf}
\caption{Example spectrum of \shStar\ near Ca I 6162 $\AA$, another gravity sensitive line.}\label{fig:CaILine}
\end{centering}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Independent Reduction}
K Masuda independently reduced the \shStar\ Subaru data to examine if there could be an orbiting body on a highly eccentric star-grazing orbit that would reveal itself through radial velocity variations.
This more sophisticated reduction masks all telluric emission features and any outliers, producing cleaner spectra.
Time-variable outliers like cosmic rays are removed by measuring deviations from the median spectrum for the night.
The night-sky emissions from OH and O$_2$ are removed by using the \citet{osterbrock1996lineAtlas} night sky atlas.
All OH and O$_2$ lines are removed regardless if they are visible in the spectrum of \shStar.
Also, we found the median spectrum for the night (2015-05-11) to increase the signal to noise and perform outlier rejection.
The median spectrum is visible in Figure \ref{fig:mgTripletBOSZ}.

\clearpage
\subsection{Comparison to BOSZ}
The BOSZ  \citep{bohlin2017bosz} model database is calculated up to $R = 300,000$ so it should be comparable to measurements without smoothing the Subaru spectra as was necessary for the HIGHRES models above.
We start by comparing R=100,000 models with the measured spectrum of \shStar\ near the Mg triplet, shown in Figure \ref{fig:mgTripletBOSZ}.
The models are convolved with a Gaussian that has a standard deviation $\sigma_G = \lambda/57700$  to obtain a resolution of 50,000.


\begin{figure}[!hbtp]
\begin{centering}
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{images/subaru/bosz_mg_triplet.pdf}
\caption{Example spectrum of \shStar\ (reduced by Kento Masuda) near the Mg triplet compared to 4500 K BOSZ models with two different log(g)s.}\label{fig:mgTripletBOSZ}
\end{centering}
\end{figure}

The BOSZ models appear much smoother than the measured spectrum, even if we use them at the full R=100,000.
\textbf{Perhaps the micro-turbulent velocity (2 km/s) for all models is too high?}
In order for us to compare the BOSZ models and our data, we have to convolve the Subaru spectrum.
They match best if we convolve the data with a R=40,000 kernel so that we could compare the data to the BOSZ models.
Then, we explore the 5 parameters in the BOSZ models: T$_{eff}$, log(g), [M/H], [$\alpha$/M] and [C/M] to constrain these parameters in \shStar.
For each parameter, we change the models by about 2 steps in the BOSZ grid.
For a quantitative measure of the goodness-of-fit, we calculate a $\chi^2$ over the Mg triplet lines from 5160 to 5190 $\AA$.
The errors are estimated from the standard deviation of the spectra over the night.
For now, we ignore the smoothing of the data that creates non-zero off-diagonal terms in the covariance matrix.

The sensitivity to each parameter for the BOSZ models are shown in Figure \ref{fig:boszModelParamsMedianSpec}.
A temperature near 4500 K, log(g) = 4.0-4.5, high metallicity ([M/H] $\approx$ 0.5), low $\alpha$ enrichment ($\alpha \approx -0.25$ and solar Carbon to metals ([C/M] $\approx$ 0) are favored by the models.

\end{centering}
\end{figure*}

\subsubsection{$\chi^2$ Minimization}
We downloaded a grid of BOSZ models with temperatures ranging from 4250 K to 4750 K, Log(g) from 4.0 to 4.5, [M/H] from 0.0 to 0.5, [C/M]=0.0 and [$\alpha$/M] = -0.25 to 0.0.
As discussed above, we use an approximate $\chi^2$ statistic over the wavelength range covering the Mg triplet (5160 $\AA$ to 5190 $\AA$).
The minimum $\chi^2$ model for this entire grid is the same as shown in Figure \ref{fig:boszModelParamsMedianSpec}: T=4500 K, Log(g)=4.5, M/H=0.0, C/M=0.0, $\alpha=-0.25$.


\subsection{Specmatch}\label{sec:SpecMatch}

We also use the \texttt{specmatch} tool \citep{yee2017specMatch} to estimate the stellar parameters using the Subaru spectrum.
\texttt{specmatch} uses a library of Keck HIRES spectra to match the spectrum and derive stellar parameters.
As with the comparisons to the BOSZ models, we first convolve the median spectrum from \citet{masuda2018rvKIC1255} with a R=40,000 kernel.
We cut the spectrum to a region from 5140~$\AA$ to 5190~$\AA$ to focus on the gravity-sensitive Mg triplet.

Figure \ref{fig:specMatch} shows the chi-squared differences between the median Subaru spectrum and the models.
The effective temperature radius show clear global $\chi^2$ minima for the HIRES spectral libraries.
The resulting best-fit parameters are T$_{eff}$=4500 K, [Fe/H]=-0.1$\pm$0.1, log(g)=4.5$\pm$0.1, R=0.7 $\pm$ 0.1 R$_\odot$.
We summarize these \texttt{specmatch} and BOSZ results in Table \ref{tab:stellObsParams}.

\section{Kepler Re-analysis}
We examine the 17 total quarters of Kepler data for three purposes:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item To understand the statistics of the transits and put our 2013-2016 observations in context. Mainly, how likely/unlikely were the weak transits observed in 2013-2014?
	\item To measure the radius of the planet or put an upper limit on its radius by examining any possible transit beneath the dust signal
	\item Identify any new patterns or observations from the Kepler data that might occur along the way
\end{enumerate}

We downloaded all 17 quarters of Kepler Long-Cadence data from the MAST archive beginning on 2009-05-13 and ending on 2013-04-08 for a total of 1425 days or 2181.5 orbits.
The Kepler data were examined for one transit or secondary eclipse at a time with a window of $\pm$0.28 in orbital phase.
A quadratic baseline is fit to all the points before a phase of 0.12 and after a phase of 0.15 with thin the $\pm$ 0.28 window.
All points are divided by this baseline to produce a normalized flux transit or eclipse profile.
The secondary eclipses are used to quantify the noise in the transit depths.

We confirm the result of \citet{vanWerkhoven2014} that no secondary eclipse is detected a at $\lesssim 50$ ppm, seen in Figure \ref{fig:secEclipse}. 
The constraint is even tighter assuming a circular orbit.

\caption{No secondary eclipse ( $\lesssim$ 50 ppm) is detected from a phase range of -0.25 to 0.75, even with 17 quarters (4 years) of Kepler Long Cadence data.
Here the data are binned to orbital phases of 0.1 or 1.5 minutes and errors calculated from the standard error in the mean of the data.
}\label{fig:secEclipse}
\end{centering}
\end{figure*}

In order to perform some analysis techniques on the data and to study the transit depth behavior, we first create a uniform cleaned two dimensional array of the time series.
We interpolated the Kepler long-cadence data set onto a fixed phase grid with a spacing of 30 minutes and put together all the time series that have no gaps into this two dimensional grid.
This cleaned Kepler long-cadence array is shown in Figure \ref{fig:kepPCA}.

\caption{Cleaned Kepler Long-cadence data (Left) and model fit (Right).}\label{fig:kepPCA}
\end{centering}
\end{figure*}

We take the dot product ($\bullet$) with the first principal component to create an amplitude time series.
\begin{equation}
A = \frac{(f - 1) \bullet c_1}{c_1 \bullet c_1},
\end{equation}
where $A$ is the amplitude vector, $f$ is the flux matrix with x indices of time and y indices of transit number and $c_1$ is the vector of the first principal component .

%% In a manner similar to \objectname authors can provide links to dataset
%% hosted at participating data centers via the \dataset{} command.  The
%% second curly bracket argument is printed in the text while the first
%% parentheses argument serves as the valid data set identifier.  Large
%% lists of data set are best provided in a table (see Table 3 for an example).
%% Valid data set identifiers should be obtained from the data center that
%% is currently hosting the data.
%%
%% Note that AASTeX interprets everything between the curly braces in the 
%% macro as regular text, so any special characters, e.g. "#" or "_," must be 
%% preceded by a backslash. Otherwise, you will get a LaTeX error when you 
%% compile your manuscript.  Special characters do not 
%% need to be escaped in the optional, square-bracket argument.



%% In this section, we use  the \subsection command to set off
%% a subsection.  \footnote is used to insert a footnote to the text.

%% Observe the use of the LaTeX \label
%% command after the \subsection to give a symbolic KEY to the
%% subsection for cross-referencing in a \ref command.
%% You can use LaTeX's \ref and \label commands to keep track of
%% cross-references to sections, equations, tables, and figures.
%% That way, if you change the order of any elements, LaTeX will
%% automatically renumber them.

%% This section also includes several of the displayed math environments
%% mentioned in the Author Guide.


%% The equation environment wil produce a numbered display equation.


%% The \notetoeditor{TEXT} command allows the author to communicate
%% information to the copy editor.  This information will appear as a
%% footnote on the printed copy for the manuscript style file.  Nothing will
%% appear on the printed copy if the preprint or
%% preprint2 style files are used.

%% The eqnarray environment produces multi-line display math. The end of
%% each line is marked with a \\. Lines will be numbered unless the \\
%% is preceded by a \nonumber command.
%% Alignment points are marked by ampersands (&). There should be two
%% ampersands (&) per line.

%% Putting eqnarrays or equations inside the mathletters environment groups
%% the enclosed equations by letter. For instance, the eqnarray below, instead
%% of being numbered, say, (4) and (5), would be numbered (4a) and (4b).
%% LaTeX the paper and look at the output to see the results.

%% This section contains more display math examples, including unnumbered
%% equations (displaymath environment). The last paragraph includes some
%% examples of in-line math featuring a couple of the AASTeX symbol macros.

%% The displaymath environment will produce the same sort of equation as
%% the equation environment, except that the equation will not be numbered
%% by LaTeX.
%% If you wish to include an acknowledgments section in your paper,
%% separate it off from the body of the text using the \acknowledgments
%% command.

%% Included in this acknowledgments section are examples of the
%% AASTeX hypertext markup commands. Use \url without the optional [HREF]
%% argument when you want to print the url directly in the text. Otherwise,
%% use either \url or \anchor, with the HREF as the first argument and the
%% text to be printed in the second.

\acknowledgments



%% To help institutions obtain information on the effectiveness of their
%% telescopes, the AAS Journals has created a group of keywords for telescope
%% facilities. A common set of keywords will make these types of searches
%% significantly easier and more accurate. In addition, they will also be
%% useful in linking papers together which utilize the same telescopes
%% within the framework of the National Virtual Observatory.
%% See the AASTeX Web site at http://aastex.aas.org/
%% for information on obtaining the facility keywords.

%% After the acknowledgments section, use the following syntax and the
%% \facility{} macro to list the keywords of facilities used in the research
%% for the paper.  Each keyword will be checked against the master list during
%% copy editing.  Individual instruments or configurations can be provided 
%% in parentheses, after the keyword, but they will not be verified.

%{\it Facilities:} \facility{Nickel}, \facility{HST (STIS)}, \facility{CXO (ASIS)}.

%% Appendix material should be preceded with a single \appendix command.
%% There should be a \section command for each appendix. Mark appendix
%% subsections with the same markup you use in the main body of the paper.

%% Each Appendix (indicated with \section) will be lettered A, B, C, etc.
%% The equation counter will reset when it encounters the \appendix
%% command and will number appendix equations (A1), (A2), etc.

\appendix

%% The reference list follows the main body and any appendices.
%% Use LaTeX's thebibliography environment to mark up your reference list.
%% Note \begin{thebibliography} is followed by an empty set of
%% curly braces.  If you forget this, LaTeX will generate the error
%% "Perhaps a missing \item?".
%%
%% thebibliography produces citations in the text using \bibitem-\cite
%% cross-referencing. Each reference is preceded by a
%% \bibitem command that defines in curly braces the KEY that corresponds
%% to the KEY in the \cite commands (see the first section above).
%% Make sure that you provide a unique KEY for every \bibitem or else the
%% paper will not LaTeX. The square brackets should contain
%% the citation text that LaTeX will insert in
%% place of the \cite commands.

%% We have used macros to produce journal name abbreviations.
%% AASTeX provides a number of these for the more frequently-cited journals.
%% See the Author Guide for a list of them.

%% Note that the style of the \bibitem labels (in []) is slightly
%% different from previous examples.  The natbib system solves a host
%% of citation expression problems, but it is necessary to clearly
%% delimit the year from the author name used in the citation.
%% See the natbib documentation for more details and options.

%% for specific submissions guidelines as they vary from
%% journal to journal.

%% This example uses \plotone to include an EPS file scaled to

%% If you are not including electonic art with your submission, you may
%% mark up your captions using the \figcaption command. See the
%% User Guide for details.
%%
%% No more than seven \figcaption commands are allowed per page,
%% so if you have more than seven captions, insert a \clearpage
%% after every seventh one.

%% Tables should be submitted one per page, so put a \clearpage before
%% each one.

%% Two options are available to the author for producing tables:  the
%% deluxetable environment provided by the AASTeX package or the LaTeX
%% table environment.  Use of deluxetable is preferred.
%%

%% Three table samples follow, two marked up in the deluxetable environment,
%% one marked up as a LaTeX table.

%% In this first example, note that the \tabletypesize{}
%% command has been used to reduce the font size of the table.
%% We also use the \rotate command to rotate the table to
%% landscape orientation since it is very wide even at the
%% reduced font size.
%%
%% Note also that the \label command needs to be placed
%% inside the \tablecaption.

%% This table also includes a table comment indicating that the full
%% version will be available in machine-readable format in the electronic
%% edition.

%% If you use the table environment, please indicate horizontal rules using
%% \tableline, not \hline.
%% Do not put multiple tabular environments within a single table.
%% The optional \label should appear inside the \caption command.



%% If the table is more than one page long, the width of the table can vary
%% from page to page when the default \tablewidth is used, as below.  The
%% individual table widths for each page will be written to the log file; a
%% maximum tablewidth for the table can be computed from these values.
%% The \tablewidth argument can then be reset and the file reprocessed, so
%% that the table is of uniform width throughout. Try getting the widths
%% from the log file and changing the \tablewidth parameter to see how
%% adjusting this value affects table formatting.

%% The \dataset{} macro has also been applied to a few of the objects to
%% show how many observations can be tagged in a table.


%% Tables may also be prepared as separate files. See the accompanying
%% sample file table.tex for an example of an external table file.
%% To include an external file in your main document, use the \input
%% command. Uncomment the line below to include table.tex in this
%% sample file. (Note that you will need to comment out the \documentclass,
%% \begin{document}, and \end{document} commands from table.tex if you want
%% to include it in this document.)

%% \input{table}

%% The following command ends your manuscript. LaTeX will ignore any text
%% that appears after it.

\end{document}
