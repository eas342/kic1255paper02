Dr. Endl,

Thank you to the referee for the helpful suggestions on this paper.

We have made the following revisions based on the comments from the referee.

- Minor wording corrections including lower case "b" in the title and corrected "of" typo with "off"

- We changed the wording of the contamination of the high resolution spectrum by debris evaporating from the planet to emphasize that it is at a level below that which could change stellar parameters, but not necessarily undetectable.

- We have only included the frequencies above the Nyquist rate in the periodograms.
