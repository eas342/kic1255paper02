Dr. Endl,

Thank you to the referee for the helpful suggestions on this paper.

We have included one plot that was requested by the referee but that is not currently included in the paper that shows the ratio of the two principal components PC2/PC1. The referee suggests a time series of the rati of PC2 to PC1 to highlight the differences in the shape of the light curve rather than just the overall amplitude. We have uploaded this plot for the referee, but not included it in the new draft because we do not feel that it helps elucidate the light curve changes. The difficulty with using the ratio of the two principal components is that the two components are uncorrelated by definition. Since they are uncorrelated, dividing PC2 will not remove the effect of deep transits from PC1 the way we would hope.

We have made the following revisions based on the comments from the referee.

- Minor wording corrections including lower case "b" in the title and corrected "of" typo with "off"

- We changed the wording of the contamination of the high resolution spectrum by debris evaporating from the planet to emphasize that it is at a level below that which could change stellar parameters, but not necessarily undetectable.

- We have only included the frequencies above the Nyquist rate in the periodograms.

- We have offered an explanation for why the Gaussian kernel is a slightly broader function than expected from combing inverse resolutions in quadrature.

- We adjusted the time series figure as requested with typical error bars, a line at 0 and better labeling of the Kepler vs. Ground-based data. However, we have not included the ratio of PC1 to PC2.

- We have offered an explanation of why the observed resolution did not quite match expectations from the convolution with model - it is likely due to the non-Gaussian shape of the line spread function.
