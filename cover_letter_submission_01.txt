Dr. Endl,

Thank you to the referee for the helpful suggestions on this paper.

We have included one plot that was requested by the referee but that is not currently included in the paper that shows the ratio of the two principal components PC2/PC1. The referee suggests a time series of the rati of PC2 to PC1 to highlight the differences in the shape of the light curve rather than just the overall amplitude. We have uploaded this plot for the referee, but not included it in the new draft because we do not feel that it helps elucidate the light curve changes. The difficulty with using the ratio of the two principal components is that the two components are uncorrelated by definition. Since they are uncorrelated, dividing PC2 will not remove the effect of deep transits from PC1 the way we would hope.

We have added a short new section on stellar activity. As the referee has requested, we moved the discussion of un-occulted spots and transit depths from Kawahara et al. 2014 and Croll et al. 2016 into this new section. We have mainly added in the new work from Rackham et al. 2018 to check how a more realistic spot covering fraction might have affected previous conclusions. In the end, we find that the conclusion in Croll et al. 2016 that *un-occulted* spots are not responsible for the transit depth variations is still likely true. This is to distinguish from the effects of *occulted* spots. We have added Benjamin Rackham to the author list because he has now provided substantial contributions to its intellectual content.

There have also been 3 important changes to the calculation of the un-occulted star spot bias: (1) The coefficients for the scaling relation that Rackham et al. originally sent our team were derived from models looks at I-band photometric variability.  Since then and before submission, Rackham et al. updated the analysis to use the Kepler bandpass, as there's a large dataset of observed variabilities for comparison (McQuillan et al. 2014 as in the paper). (2)  The contamination estimates in the introduction of the original submission are for a "typical" K4V, which at the time were assumed to have an I-band variability of 1%.  Now, the latest estimates for spot coverage and stellar contamination in the attached draft are derived from stellar contamination spectra that were calculated assuming a 0.8% variability in the Kepler bandpass, which is the case for KIC 1255. (3) Additionally, the 5–30% were for a worst-case scenario of a K4V spectrum from a plot. Now, the 1–6% estimate comes from an exact calculation of the mean value of the stellar contamination factor at wavelengths 0.4–0.9 µm.

The statistical analysis of the principal components is indeed important to our arguments. First, we have included a justification for our choice of keeping 4 principal components. Second, we include _______________ statistics.

We have also added a short section on the spectral energy distribution and stellar radius. Ask prompted by the referee, we use the spectral energy distribution and Gaia DR2 parallaxes to derive a stellar radius to confirm the analysis of the spectrum. While examining the spectral energy distribution, we also note that there is an infrared excess in WISE bands 3 and 4 that may arise from a debris disk, so this is shown in a new spectral energy distribution figure.

As requested, we have discussed the long term behavior of WD 1145+017 in comparison to KIC 1255.

We have made the following revisions based on the comments from the referee.

- Minor wording corrections including lower case "b" in the title and corrected "of" typo with "off"

- We changed the wording of the contamination of the high resolution spectrum by debris evaporating from the planet to emphasize that it is at a level below that which could change stellar parameters, but not necessarily undetectable.

- We have only included the frequencies above the Nyquist rate in the periodograms.

- We have offered an explanation for why the Gaussian kernel is a slightly broader function than expected from combing inverse resolutions in quadrature.

- We adjusted the time series figure as requested with typical error bars, a line at 0 and better labeling of the Kepler vs. Ground-based data. However, we have not included the ratio of PC1 to PC2.

- We have offered an explanation of why the observed resolution did not quite match expectations from the convolution with model - it is likely due to the non-Gaussian shape of the line spread function.
