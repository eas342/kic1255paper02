Dr. Endl,

We wish to thank the referee for the helpful suggestions on this paper.

We have included one plot that was requested by the referee but that is not currently included in the paper that shows the ratio of the two principal components PC2/PC1. This file is called "pc_ratio.pdf". The referee suggests a time series of the ratio of PC2 to PC1 to highlight the differences in the shape of the light curve rather than just the overall amplitude. We have uploaded this plot for the referee, but have not included it in the new draft because we do not feel that it helps elucidate the light curve changes. The difficulty with using the ratio of the two principal components is that the two components are uncorrelated by definition (with orthogonal eigenvectors). Since they are uncorrelated, dividing PC2 by PC1 will not remove the effect of deep transits from PC1. On the other hand, the significant variations in PC2 discussed below represent true changes in the light curve shape that are not encapsulated by a single eigenvector associated with the first principal component.

The statistical analysis of the principal components is indeed important to our arguments. First, we have included a justification for our choice of keeping 4 principal components. As now described in the text, one PC is added at a time until the in-transit and out-of-transit noise levels are the same. Second, we include false alarm levels and error bars for each principal component's time series to help readers assess the likelihoods.

We have added a short new section on stellar activity. We moved the discussion of un-occulted spots and transit depths from Kawahara et al. 2014 and Croll et al. 2016 into this new section. We have mainly added in the new work from Rackham et al. 2018 to check how a more realistic spot covering fraction might have affected previous conclusions. In the end, we find that the conclusion in Croll et al. 2016 that *un-occulted* spots are not responsible for the transit depth variations is still likely true. This is to distinguish from the effects of *occulted* spots, which Croll et al. 2016 suspect is the cause of the anti-correlations between stellar flux and transit depth. We have moved Benjamin Rackham from the acknowledgements to the author list because he has now provided substantial contributions to its intellectual content.

There have also been 3 important changes to the calculation of the un-occulted star spot bias: (1) The coefficients for the scaling relation that Rackham et al. originally sent our team were derived from I-band photometric variability.  Since then and before submission, Rackham et al. updated the analysis to use the Kepler bandpass because there is a large dataset of observed Kepler variabilities for comparison (McQuillan et al. 2014). (2)  The contamination estimates in the introduction of the original submission are for a "typical" K4V star, which at the time were assumed to have an I-band variability of 1%.  Now, the latest estimates for spot coverage and stellar contamination in the attached draft are derived from stellar contamination spectra that were calculated assuming a 0.8% variability in the Kepler bandpass, which is the case for KIC 1255. (3) Additionally, the 5–30% in the original draft were for a worst-case scenario of a K4V spectrum from a plot. Now, the 1–6% estimate comes from an exact calculation of the mean value of the stellar contamination factor over the wavelength range of 0.4–0.9 µm.

We have also added a short section on the spectral energy distribution and stellar radius. Ask prompted by the referee, we use the spectral energy distribution and Gaia DR2 parallaxes to derive a stellar radius to confirm the analysis of the spectrum.

As requested, we have discussed the long term behavior of WD 1145+017 in comparison to KIC 1255.

We have made the following revisions based on the comments from the referee.

- Minor wording corrections including lower case "b" in the title and corrected "of" typo with "off"

- We changed the wording of the contamination of the high resolution spectrum by debris evaporating from the planet to emphasize that it is at a level below that which could change stellar parameters, but not necessarily undetectable.

- We have only included the frequencies above the Nyquist rate in the periodograms.

- We adjusted the time series figure as requested with typical error bars, added a horizontal line at 0 and improved the labels of the Kepler vs. Ground-based data.

- We have offered an explanation of why the observed resolution did not quite match expectations from a convolution of a model with a Gaussian. It is likely due to the non-Gaussian shape of the line spread function.
